    <h2>Debunking Misconceptions</h2>
    <p>People should learn how to tell the difference between accurate and false news by teaching the truth and the consequences of fake news. People should also acquire practical techniques to combat the spread of false information. Generally, our goal is to foster critical thinking on news and media (Cooper, 2014). There are several common misconceptions about fake news that need to be debunked:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Misconception:</strong> Fake news only affects gullible people.</li>
      <li><strong>Fact:</strong> Fake news can affect anyone, regardless of intelligence or education level. It spreads quickly on social media and can deceive even the most discerning individuals.</li>
      <li><strong>Misconception:</strong> Fact-checking websites are always accurate.</li>
      <li><strong>Fact:</strong> While fact-checking websites are valuable resources, they are not infallible. It's essential to cross-reference information from multiple sources. Everyone around the world should come together to fight against fake news. We can create a society that is better prepared and knows the truth. We can stop false information from spreading.</li>
