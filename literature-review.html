Scholastic articles and books have contributed to our understanding of fake news and its implications. Works like "F for Fake: Propaganda! Hoaxing! Hacking! Partisanship! and Activism! in the Fake News Ecology" by Reilly (2018) provide critical analyses of the socio-political dynamics surrounding fake news dissemination and its broader impact on society. Academic journals like Information Processing & Management have published comprehensive overviews of online fake news, discussing its characterization, detection methods, and implications for information management and dissemination. Zhang and Ghorbani's (2020) review offers valuable insights into the technological and algorithmic challenges in combating fake news and the role of digital literacy in addressing this issue (Annafri et al., 2023).
